# UW-MRI Reconstruction Toolbox
This is reconstruction code developed for MRI reconstructions, primarily non-cartesian data but will work with arbitrary code. It has a bit of a focus on iterative reconstructions using coil sensitvities derieved from the data (e.g. ESPIRiT ). 

# Software dependencies
* Blitz++ a template array library, used for 3D+ arrays
* Armadillo a linear algebra package. It is highly recomended you install with the Intel MKL package
* HDF5 C++ library
* FFTW with OpenMp support 
* Voro++ a 3D voronoi diagram package (used for sampling density estimates)
